## Recommended maps to play with:

* [Day of the Acolyte](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/strife/kaiser_23)
  - A strife wad by Samuel 'Kaiser' Villarreal. You wondered though the wilderness, searching for food until you were spotted by an acolyte. The remains of the Order lurks within a small complex, planning their war with Blackbird and the rebels. Suspected as a spy, you remain in their detention center. A group of acolytes and a officer inter your cell, preparing for your torture. You will not give up without a fight.... This is a single map wad for Strife map02. Its pretty long too with lots of places to explore. In this map you will need to rely on shops and stealth in order to beat this map.

* [Return of The Order](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/strife/kaiser_13)
  - A strife wad by Samuel 'Kaiser' Villarreal. The Order has returned and has taken over your headquaters. Its up to you to stop them agian

* [Strife: Low on Ice - Enhanced](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=78828)
  - Six maps for Strife: a hub, three shorter maps, a larger piece and a progression stopper finale

* [A World in Strife: Absolute Order](https://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/54783-strife-absolute-order-update-8-03-12-1-map-demo-available/)
  - Six map hub for Strife. Despite the main threat of the order being defeated, there are many other towns still under their fragmented rule. The front now has the resources to send agents to these outward places and attempt to destroy what's left of the tyranny. You have arrived in the small town of Sweetwater, where what few people survive live a near meaningless life that is under constant threat.

* [A World in Strife: Raiding the Dam](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/48920-released-a-world-in-strife-raiding-the-dam/)
  - A large single player level for Strife. Features an mp3 soundtrack written specifically for it (a high quality download of which can be found on the DW forums post http://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/48920-a-world-in-strife-raiding-the-dam/). No real story or npc interaction other than some vendors, just a new part of the strife world to explore.

* [UniStrife](https://www.moddb.com/mods/unistrife)
  - This is a fun little mod that unifies some of the maps from other WADs (like Doom, Heretic) and adds some additional content alongside that too.

## Recommended mods to combine with:

* [VR Flashlight:](https://github.com/iAmErmac/VR-Flashlight)
  - Since the included flashlight has been removed, you are required to use this Flashlight mod instead
  
* [Hyper-V:](https://github.com/iAmErmac/Hyper-V)
  - Enables a lot of VR focused features such as positional melee attacks and item pulling
  
* [DamNums:](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=55048)
  - DamNums is a pretty simple concept: shoot monsters and little numbers pop out that tell you how much damage you did
  
* [Top HP Bars:](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=55048)
  - Really simple mod to add HP bars on top of enemies and players. Performance version is recommended for VR
