## Recommended mods to combine with:

* [VR Flashlight:](https://github.com/iAmErmac/VR-Flashlight)
  - Since the included flashlight has been removed, you are required to use this Flashlight mod instead
  
* [Hyper-V:](https://github.com/iAmErmac/Hyper-V)
  - Enables a lot of VR focused features such as positional melee attacks and item pulling
  
* [DamNums:](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=55048)
  - DamNums is a pretty simple concept: shoot monsters and little numbers pop out that tell you how much damage you did
  
* [Top HP Bars:](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=55048)
  - Really simple mod to add HP bars on top of enemies and players. Performance version is recommended for VR
